# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability in this project, please report it by opening a private issue or contacting the maintainers directly. Do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been addressed.

The project does not collect or store user credentials. Chrome is started in incognito mode so that browsing data is not preserved after the session ends.
Store Telegram tokens in environment variables or the `.telegram_token` file, which is ignored by version control.
